# Experiment with Amplify Impostors in Unity

## Description
I investigated the shape of Amplify Impostors that can maintain beauty.
Using eight cubes, I made L-type, L-type, and O-type, made them into posters, and compared their beauty.
## Result
Beauty was maintained in the order of O-type, L-type, and I-type.
The reason that Type I objects cannot maintain their beauty is because Amplify Impostors generates textures based on the longest part of the object.

## Idea
Even an I-shaped object, if it is a single and has a shape like a stick candy, can make a beautiful impostor. 
Separating the candy and the stick, making the candy part an poster, and making the stick part a billboard, you can display beautifully and lightly. Since there are two materials, it will be heavy if you draw a lot.
